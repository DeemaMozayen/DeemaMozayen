- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DeemaMozayen;
- I studied mechanical engineering at university and worked in the pharmaceutical industry for 3 years.
- I am looking to expand my skillset by learning to code (mainly in Python) and have begun building my own projects, in addition to those I completed as part of the Codecadamy course in Python 3.
